# Monthly-Bill-Generator
This project is a Monthly Bill Generator built in Python for a workspace rental company. It takes a list of rented items (with start and end dates, rate, and quantity) and calculates a prorated monthly invoice based on usage during a given month. It groups similar items, calculates partial usage accurately, and returns the final monthly bill.
